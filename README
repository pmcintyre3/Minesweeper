What is It?
-----------

Minesweeper Recursive Edition is a terminal based implimentation
of Minesweeper using recursion to detect nearby mines. The game can 
have a maximum of 10 rows and 10 columns. To win, all mines must be
marked with the marked command and all other tiles must have been 
revealed.

How to Play
-----------

Starting the game requires you to compile and run from the command line.
To do this, skip to the 'Makefile' section below.

Upon starting the game, a board will be drawn on the screen with the
corresponding width and height and you will be prompted for an action. 
There are 5 options to choose from: Reveal, Mark, Guess, Help, and Quit. 
Each option can be typed entirely or by just typing the first letter. After
selection an option, type it when prompted followed by a space and two numbers,
row and column, separated by a space. For example, if you wish to reveal the
space at (1,2), you would type "reveal 1 2" or "r 1 2". Both are acceptable
forms of input. Each time you input an action, the gameboard will update. The
game continues until you win or reveal a mine.

How to Win
----------
Knowing where the mines are located is very important. Strategically reveal
portions of the map until you have located a mine. You "mark" portions of the
grid where you suspect a mine to be located. If you happen to mark all of the
mines and reveal the rest of the map, you win!


Makefile
--------

To run the program, you must compile each of the components. To compile everything
at once, type the following into the command line (typing 'all' is optional)
     
     $make (all)


You may compile the files individually if you wish. To compile the
main function separately, type the following into the command line

     $make main

Additionally, to compile the Minesweeper.cpp file, type the following into 
the command line

     $make Minesweeper

Finally, we create the Minesweeper executable by typing the following into 
the command line (typing 'all' is optional)

    $make (all)

To run the file, type the following, where 'seed1' is a premade
seed file. Please note that the seed file does not have an extention.
     
     $./Minesweeper seed1

To delete extraneous files, type the following into the command line

     $make clean

Seed File
---------
The seed file must be organized by line. The first line must 
contain the number of rows and columns seperated by whitespace (' ').
The second row contains the number of mines. The rows that follow are
coordinates for the mines. The number of mine coordinate lines cannot
exceed the number of mines on the second row, or will result in an error.
Example seed file ('seed1'):

	10 10
	4
	0 0
	1 1
	2 2
	3 3

The Minesweeper grid will be set to 10 x 10 due to the first line. The second
line lists the number of mines to be added ('4'). The subsequent lines are the
coordinates for the individual mines, listed 'row col'. Note there are 4 coordinates
listed because the second line specifies the number of mines to be 4.

What is It?
-----------

Minesweeper Recursive Edition is a terminal based implimentation
of Minesweeper using recursion to detect nearby mines. The game can 
have a maximum of 10 rows and 10 columns. To win, all mines must be
marked with the marked command and all other tiles must have been 
revealed.

main function, type the following into the command line

     $make main

To compile the Minesweeper.cpp file, type the following into the 
command line

     $make Minesweeper

To create the Minesweeper executable, type the following into

Seed File
---------
The seed file must be organized by line. The first line must 
contain the number of rows and columns seperated by whitespace (' ').
The second row contains the number of mines. The rows that follow are
coordinates for the mines. The number of mine coordinate lines cannot
exceed the number of mines on the second row, or will result in an error.
